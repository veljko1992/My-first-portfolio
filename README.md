# My-first-portfolio

 This project represents my final work at Krojac School. The theme of the project is my portfolio.
 
This project is on one page that contains several parts such as my works, something about me and a contact form. The aim of the project is to bring together the knowledge acquired on the web design course of the Krojac school and introduce myself.
The structure of the project is clearly divided into folders.
The project is styled with CSS, which is marked with comments for each section.
I have used a Bootstrap framework. There are a few functions in the java-script that serve to make the website more responsive and useful.
The whole project is in PHP so that clients can send me the mail.
